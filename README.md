## Dynamic Pixel Inspector

The Dynamic Pixel Inspector is useful for exploring the time-activity curves
of dynamic (2D + time or 3D + time - HyperStacks). Once activated, it will
display a plot of the gray intensity for each voxel through time (x axis)
as the mouse moves over the image. If the image has the focus and the user
presses the 'q' key, the plot stops updating in case a screenshot needs to
be taken. When the 'q' key is pressed again, the live updating resumes.
